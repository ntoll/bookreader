Around Brighton, where I grew up, sound systems could set up in a forgotten pocket of the South Downs for a few brief hours before being disturbed by a police force now empowered by the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act of 1994 to shut us down.

And to an adolescent growing up in the consumerist nineties, seven years after the fall of the Berlin Wall and seventeen years into the rule of Margaret Thatcher\u2019s Conservative party where alternative ideas about how to live seemed only to exist to sell ice cream and health drinks, it was also an escape. I\u2019d often wondered what had happened to all the hippies. My favourite film at that time was <em>Easy Rider</em>.

In that short time, WikiLeaks has been behind more scoops than the <em>Washington Post</em> has notched up in 30 years. In the UK in 2009, it was at the centre of two major news stories. The first was about the use of libel law to gag reporting about a company who had dumped toxic waste illegally off the coast of Cote d\u2019Ivoire leaving thousands of locals sick and at least a dozen dead. The scandal led to serious initiatives to reform libel laws in the UK. The second, when WikiLeaks published over 1,000 emails sent over a period of ten years between scientists at the Climatic Research Institute in Norwich, UK, pretty much derailed international talks on climate change the following month in Copenhagen. WikiLeaks has broken stories of similar national and international importance in Venezuela, Peru, Kenya, the United States and Mexico. And in Iceland they are national heroes, after they published records showing exactly which of Iceland\u2019s banking elite withdrew all their funds from the failed bank Kaupthing days before it collapsed in 2008.</p>",

A two-page spread is given over to the works of Buckminster Fuller. The September 1966 edition of <em>Scientific American</em>, subtitled simply \u201cInformation\u201d, is touted as \u201cthe best introduction we\u2019ve seen to computer science\u201d. Opposite it sits a gushing review of the HP 9100A Calculator, \u201cthe best of the new tabletop number-crunchers\u201d. On the previous page sits a review of <em>The Human Biocomputer,</em> an exploration into psychedelics and sensory deprivation by the neuroscientist John Lily, inventor of the flotation tank. The page following it features the McGraw-Hill encyclopaedia of Space.</p>",

The scene is exactly as you would expect if you had followed BoingBoing.net for any length of time. When I was first getting into geek culture, BoingBoing.net was my guide, and Cory Doctorow my hero. The first time I met him was at the 2004 Big Brother Awards ceremony, a tongue-in-cheek annual event run by Privacy International to name and shame people who do damage to privacy and civil rights (the winners, which that year included British Gas and the NHS IT programme, rarely show up to collect their honours). I had no idea what he looked like, but I guessed who he was from his punk leather jacket and vintage specs, not to mention his entourage. Cory manages to capture much of what is hip about being a geek, while remaining earnestly committed to hacker values.

I grew up in an age where meaning \u2013 collective meaning, morals, ethics, religion etc \u2013 had fallen out of fashion. Without meaning, all that was left was the bottom line: everything beyond profit and loss was merely a matter of spin. Freedom to me meant space, yes, but it also meant finding a knowledge and a truth that could be more relied upon. Freeing information, taking it out of the hands of the intermediaries, be they governments, media conglomerates or corporate advertising executives, seemed like a good step on the way to that dream. I can\u2019t be sure, but I think that\u2019s also what John Perry Barlow meant by freedom when he talked about his \u201ccivilization of the Mind in Cyberspace&#8230; more humane and fair than the world your governments have made before.\u201d</p>",

Some people like to call that last set of activities cracking, not hacking, and I\u2019ve used \u201ccracking\u201d once or twice myself. Not all hacking is done with good intentions, of course. But thankfully for all of us, hackers have deployed a failsafe system for recognising each other\u2019s intentions, based on the wearing of hats. A white-hatted hacker works for the public good. A black-hatted hacker is motivated by malice or personal gain. A grey-hatted hacker is somewhere in between. Watch out for hackers wearing hats!</p>",
