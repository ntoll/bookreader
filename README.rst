Bookreader
==========

A simple web-based social book reading application that sits upon Fluidinfo.

It's also an example from the O'Reilly book "Getting Started with Fluidinfo".

Getting Started
---------------

Once you have cloned this repos you need to issue the following commands in
the project root::

  $ git submodule init
  $ git submodule update

You'll then find the fluidinfo.js source in the js/fi directory and the
mustache.js source in the js/mustache directory (relative to the project root).
